Module 8: Infrastructure Testing and Validation
1.Validating Configuration Syntax: Before deploying infrastructure, it’s critical to ensure the configuration files are syntactically correct.
What this means:
    Checking Terraform files for errors
    Ensuring required variables are defined
    Making sure providers and resources are correctly declared
Why it matters:
    Prevents failed deployments
    Catches mistakes early in the development cycle
commands: 
    terraform validate
    terraform fmt
2.Implementing Automated Testing for Infrastructure
Manual testing doesn’t scale well. Automated testing ensures infrastructure behaves consistently across environments.
Key concepts:
    Testing infrastructure automatically during builds
    Verifying resources are created, configured, and destroyed correctly
Benefits:
    Faster feedback
    Reduced human error
    Reliable deployments
3.Using Testing Frameworks (e.g., Terratest)
Terratest is a popular framework used to test Terraform code using Go.
Why Terratest is useful:
    Tests real cloud resources
    Integrates well with CI/CD pipelines
4.Ensuring Infrastructure Compliance and Security
Infrastructure must comply with organizational and legal standards.
Topics covered:
Enforcing security rules (e.g., no public databases)
Checking compliance with policies (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, etc.)
Using policy-as-code tools

Outcome:
how to prevent insecure or non-compliant infrastructure from being deployed.
